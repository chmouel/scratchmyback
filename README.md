# scratchmyback

In the realm where code takes flight, In Pipelines as Code's brilliant light,
We embark on a journey bold and free, To scratch the itch of exploration, see.

Welcome to the realm of "scratchmyback", Where innovation thrives, no looking
back. Here lies a repository, a sacred trove, Where dreams take shape, where
ideas rove.

## Buzz

"To infinity…and beyond!"
We reach for stars, beyond the known,
Pushing boundaries, seeds are sown.

"You are a sad, strange little man
and you have my pity. Farewell".
But here, no sorrow, no farewell,
Just progress, and tales to tell.

"Bonnie will be okay."
Assurance whispers in the code's sway,
Guiding us through the darkest day.

"Woody, you’re not a collector’s item,
you’re a child’s plaything."
Like Woody, we're more than what's seen,
We're creators, shaping the unseen.

"I’m sorry. I... You’re right.
I am just a little depressed.
That’s all. I can get through this."
In moments of doubt, we find our grace,
For every challenge, a new embrace.

## Conclusion

So let us scratch the itch, explore the vast,
With courage, curiosity unsurpassed.
For in this journey, we find our knack,
In the dance of creation, we scratch the scratch.
