In a world where code takes flight,  
And Pipelines as Code spark bright,  
We venture boldly, void of fear,  
Scratching the itch of ideas near.

Welcome to “scratchmyback,” don’t hold back!  
Where brilliance thrives, no turning back.  
A treasure trove of quirky schemes,  
Where bugs are conquered, and code dreams.

## Buzz

*"To infinity... and beyond!"*  
We stretch the code, like rubber, long.  
Boundaries break, the seeds we sow,  
In the land of commits, our branches grow.

*"You are a sad, strange little man,  
and you have my pity. Farewell."*  
But in this repo, no pity we sell,  
Just pull requests and merge success,  
A journey forward, no regrets.

*"Bonnie will be okay."*  
Assurance hums as we deploy today,  
Guiding us through the darkest night,  
With `git push` comes the morning light.

*"Woody, you’re not a collector’s item,  
you’re a child’s plaything."*  
Like Woody, our code is meant to play,  
We break, refactor, and ship today.

*"I’m sorry. I... You’re right.  
I am just a little depressed.  
That’s all. I can get through this."*  
For every bug that makes us sigh,  
We laugh, we fix, and code won’t die.

## Conclusion

So let’s scratch that back, explore the code,  
With every commit, we lighten the load.  
In this dance of creation, we find our knack,  
Forever curious, we scratch the scratch.
