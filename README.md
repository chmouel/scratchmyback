In the darkest repo, in brightest byte,  
No code shall escape our fearless might,  
We venture forth, no bugs in sight,  
To scratch the itch, in dev’s pure light.

Welcome to **scratchmyback**, where ideas grow,  
Where innovation thrives, commit flows slow.  
A sacred trove, where brilliance gleams,  
And devs unite to build their dreams.

## Buzz

*"In brightest merge, in darkest push,  
No boundary shall stay under the brush!"*  
We reach beyond, where ideas soar,  
In Pipelines as Code, we’re always more.

*"You are a sad, strange little man,  
but in this repo, no sorrow can stand!"*  
No sadness here, just progress and cheer,  
As pull requests vanish, we persevere.

*"Bonnie will be okay."*  
Through every refactor, code finds its way,  
We light the path, in errors we trust,  
With every fix, our victory’s just.

*"Woody, you’re not just a line of code,  
You’re a child’s dream, a path to upload."*  
Like Woody, our scripts aren’t just a thing,  
They’re playthings, engines—watch them spring!

*"I’m sorry. You’re right.  
I’ve got some bugs, but I'll be alright."*  
In darkest loops, we find our might,  
With every crash, we shine more bright.

## Conclusion

So, devs unite, scratch that back,  
In every byte, we find our knack.  
With courage burning, through every stack,  
We code with pride—there’s no turning back!
